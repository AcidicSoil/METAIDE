# Prompt: Create Simplified Documentation Standards

## Context
I need documentation standards for my software project that are lightweight, practical, and will actually get used by the team. Our current approach is overengineered with too many directories, excessive metadata, and formal structures that create unnecessary overhead.

## Instructions
Please create simplified documentation standards that:

1. **Prioritize practicality** - Focus on what developers actually need day-to-day rather than theoretical completeness

2. **Minimize structure overhead** - Suggest a flattened directory structure with at most 2-3 main categories

3. **Reduce metadata requirements** - Include only essential fields that provide clear value (status, owner, last updated)

4. **Emphasize maintainability** - Suggest approaches that make documentation easy to keep updated

5. **Include lightweight templates** - Provide 2-3 flexible templates that cover the most common documentation needs

6. **Integrate with development workflow** - Suggest ways to make documentation part of the natural development process rather than a separate activity

## Tone and Approach
- Be direct and concise
- Prioritize solutions that require minimal effort to maintain
- Focus on high-value documentation that directly supports development and operations
- Suggest practical ways to encourage documentation adoption

## Output Format
Please provide:
1. A brief overview of the simplified approach
2. The recommended directory structure
3. 2-3 minimal documentation templates
4. Suggestions for workflow integration
5. Implementation steps for transitioning from our current approach
