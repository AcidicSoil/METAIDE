# Universal Instruction Guide for Scalable Development & AI Interaction

## 1. General Principles for Project Structure & Development

- **Clarity & Simplicity**: Every project should prioritize readability and maintainability.
- **Modular Design**: Break down code and logic into independent, reusable components.
- **Minimalism & Efficiency**: Implement only what is necessary; avoid over-engineering.
- **Consistency**: Adhere to a uniform coding style, naming conventions, and folder structures.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the architecture allows for easy expansion without major rewrites.

## 2. Codebase Organization Guidelines

- **Folder Structure:**
  - `src/` - Main source code (organized by feature/module)
  - `docs/` - Documentation & research materials
  - `config/` - Configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`)
  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts (`.sh`, `.bat`, `.ps1`)
  - `tests/` - Unit, integration, and system tests
  - `logs/` - Log files and debugging artifacts
  - `assets/` - Static files, images, and other media
- **Version Control Best Practices:**
  - Commit frequently with meaningful messages.
  - Use feature branches for development.
  - Keep the `main` branch stable and deployable.

## 3. Automation & Tooling for Scalability

- **Automated File Sorting:**
  - Use scripts to organize codebases automatically based on file types.
- **Continuous Integration (CI/CD):**
  - Automate testing and deployment pipelines.
- **Documentation Automation:**
  - Generate documentation from structured comments and docstrings.

## 4. Best Practices for Development

- **Clean Code Principles:**
  - Use meaningful variable and function names.
  - Avoid deeply nested structures.
  - Write functions that do one thing well.
- **Documentation Standards:**
  - Include inline comments where necessary.
  - Maintain README files with installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement clear and actionable error messages.
  - Use structured logging for debugging.

## 5. Structuring Instructions for AI Models

- **Clear Formatting:**
  - Use numbered or bulleted lists for step-by-step processes.
  - Include relevant context without unnecessary information.
- **Example Query Structure:**
  ```
  I have [problem statement]. I need a solution that includes:
  1. [Specific Requirement 1]
  2. [Specific Requirement 2]
  3. [Additional Constraints or Considerations]
  Please provide clear explanations and, if possible, an implementation example.
  ```

## 6. Ensuring Scalability & Adaptability

- **Reusable Code Components:**
  - Develop utilities and libraries that can be repurposed across multiple projects.
- **Configuration-Driven Development:**
  - Externalize settings into `.json`, `.yaml`, or environment variables.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
  - Ensure scripts and tools work on multiple operating systems.

## 7. Testing & Validation Process

- **Automated Testing Workflow:**
  - Use unit tests (`pytest`, `Jest`, etc.) for core logic.
  - Implement integration tests to verify module interactions.
  - Run regression tests before major releases.
- **Manual Verification Checklist:**
  - Ensure documentation is up to date.
  - Validate that all dependencies are correctly managed.
  - Conduct security reviews for sensitive data handling.
